# WaLLy3K's GitHub pages repo
This content is for my domain https://firebog.net as well as my Big Blocklist Collection.

## Found a false positive, but don't know which list contains it?
Run `pihole -q blockeddomain.com`, and it will return the URL of the block list.

## Know which list contains the false positive?
Click on the big blue "Toggle List Maintainer Sources" button to show the source of a particular blocklist. Via the source page, you should be able to find the contact details for the list maintainer. Get in touch with them to remove the false positive - if you're not able to find the maintainer's contact details, please feel free to get in touch with me.

## Unable to find the list maintainer, they're unresponsive, or have another issue?
Open a ticket here, and I'll be happy to see what I can do.

I attempt to reply to GitHub tickets and mentions as soon <i>as soon as I notice open tickets</i>, so by all means __please__ ping me <a href="https://firebog.net/about">anywhere else that I frequent</a> that's convenient for you. Also note that if a ticket is closed, you are definitely welcome to comment on it still if you have any question, comment or concern. :smiley:
